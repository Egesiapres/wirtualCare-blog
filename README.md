A project realized during the Web Intruments and Application course, in the first year of the Master degree.
The aim was to build a thematic blog using a CMS, Wordpress, and to manage it as an editorial staff.
Me and my team customized the site aesthetic part especially thanks to Elementor. Moreover, we experimented a lot of different plug-ins.
We pulished an article every week for 6 weeks, also becoming familiar with some basic principles of SEO.
In the end, each one of us published a more large and detailed final article.
